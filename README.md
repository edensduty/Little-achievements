  # BAGELS
  
  In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you 
    must guess a secret three-digit number 
    based on clues. The game offers one of 
    the following hints in response to your guess: 
    “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the 
    wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct 
    digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess 
    has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the 
    secret number.

  # BIRTHDAY PARADOX

  The Birthday Paradox, also called the 
    Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high 
    probability that two people will have the 
    same birthday even in a small group of people. 
    In a group of 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance 
    of two people having a matching birthday. But even 
    in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a 50 percent 
    chance of a matching birthday.
